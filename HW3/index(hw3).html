    <h1 style="color:black">Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <h2 id = 'Intro'> <i>Introduction</i></h2>
    <p>My name is <b>Wanrou Yang</b>.</p>
    <p>I am currently in my third year at Northeastern University, majoring in <i>Data Science and Business Administration</i> with a concentration in Fintech. I was born and raised in Shenzhen, Chinaâ€”a vibrant city near Hong Kong known for its innovation and opportunities in high-tech industries.</p>
    <p>In my family, I have an older sister and an older brother. I am the first child to study abroad, and I feel fortunate to be in a supportive family that encourages me to pursue my passions.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, listening to music, and going to concerts. I've been to a lot of artists' concerts since I came to U.S., like Blackpink, Keshi, Niki and Post Malone. Besides, I love sports, and I play basketball almost every Friday at Marino Center. These activities help me relax and allow me to spend time with friends.</p>
    <p>I chose to study Data Science and Fintech because I want to become a Data Scientist or Business Analyst. I find it interesting to use data to predict future trends, almost like being a "predictor" in a data-driven world. As I search for Co-op positions, I've learned about the importance of collecting data, creating visualizations to help explain findings to people who aren't in the field, and forecasting outcomes. Understanding how to interpret data is crucial for making smart choices in the fast-changing world of Fintech.</p>
